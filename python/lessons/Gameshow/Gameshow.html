<p>Here’s how the program works: first, a random number between 1 and 3 is chosen, which is the door containing the prize. <code>randint(1,3)</code> means ‘choose a random integer between 1 and 3’. The program then asks the player for their choice of door, and says “Well done!” if the two numbers are the same or “Unlucky!” if they are different.</p>
<p>A random number is used so that the winning door is different every time. However, Python can’t generate random numbers without importing the code to do this, which is why the <code>random</code> library is imported at the top of the program.</p>
<p>The lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments. These comments are ignored by Python, but are really useful for reminding you what your program does! Try to use comments in your code from now on, to make difficult bits of your programs easier to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Using what you already know about loops, you could easily improve this game to allow the player to have 3 guesses, instead of just 1. Run the following program:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> random <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> *

<p>In this program, notice that the code for printing the 3 doors is <em>outside</em> of the loop, as they only need to be printed once. The code for generating random numbers and asking the player to pick a door is <em>inside</em> the loop, as these will each need to be done 3 times. If the code for choosing a random winning door was outside of the loop, then the winning door would be the same door for each of the 3 guesses.</p>
<p>Also, <code>\n</code> in the line <code>print(&quot;\nChoose a door (1, 2 or 3):&quot;)</code> prints a new blank line to the screen. This is done to split up the printed text, to make it easier to read.</p></li>

<h2>Challenge: Keeping score</h2>
<p>Create a variable to keep track of how many times the player guesses the correct door. If you need help, remember that this will work in a similar way to the <code>score</code> variable in your quiz program! Remember to show the player their final score, at the end of the program (outside of the loop).</p>

<p>A <code>while</code> loop allows your program to repeat <em>until</em> something happens to stop it. In this program, you want to keep playing the game as long as the variable <code>playing</code> is set to <code>True</code>. If the player decides that they don’t want to play again and inputs <code>n</code>, the variable <code>playing</code> is set to <code>False</code>, and the loop stops running. The name for data that is either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> is <em>Boolean</em> data.</p></li>

<h2>Challenge: Twenty-one</h2>
<p>Can you create a game where the aim is to score exactly 21 points? The program should pick a random number between 1 and 10, which is added to the player’s score. The player can then choose to stick with the score they have, or choose to add another random number to their score. The player wins the game if they manage to get to exactly 21 points. Remember to add comments to your program!</p>
<p>Here is an example of the game:</p>
<figure>
<img src="gameshow-21.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can use (or change) parts of your gameshow program to make this new game. Here are some hints that you can use to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a <code>while</code> loop to run the game as long as the player wants to keep playing:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> playing == <span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>:</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If the user enters <code>n</code> because they wish to stick with the score they have, you can set the <code>playing</code> variable to <code>False</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> answer == <span class="hljs-string">'n'</span>:
    playing = <span class="hljs-keyword">False</span></code></pre>

<ul>
<li>At the end of the program (outside of the <code>while</code> loop), you can say “Well done!” to the player if their score is exactly 21:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> score == <span class="hljs-number">21</span>:
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">print</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">"Well done!"</span>)</span></span></code></pre>
