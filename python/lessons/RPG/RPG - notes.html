<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>This project teaches game design through the development of an RPG maze game. In this game, the player has to pick up objects within a house and get to a specific room, while avoiding monsters lurking in some of the rooms. This game will be achieved by manipulating dictionaries and lists.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Children may need reminding that elements of a dictionary/list are separated by a comma. For example, when adding a new room to the ‘rooms’ dictionary, a comma needs to be added between the new room being added and the previous room.</li>
<li>When adding a new room, children may forget to add a link to an existing room to the newly created room. This will mean that children can leave a room, but not enter it!</li>
<li>The code for checking whether the player has won or lost the game needs to be indented, to ensure that this check is performed upon entering each new room. If the code isn’t indented, then it sits outside of the main game loop and is never run.</li>
</ul>
