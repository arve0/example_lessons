<h1>Step 1: Random colours</h1>
<p>First, let’s create a character that can change to a random sequence of colours for the player to memorise.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Start a new Scratch project, and delete the cat sprite so that your project is empty. You can find the online Scratch editor at <a href="http://jumpto.cc/scratch-new">jumpto.cc/scratch-new</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a character and a backdrop. Your character doesn’t have to be a person, but it needs to be able to show different colours.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-sprite.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>In your game, you’ll use a different number to represent each colour:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 = red;</li>
<li>2 = blue;</li>
<li>3 = green;</li>
<li>4 = yellow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give your character 4 different colour costumes, one for each of the 4 colours above. Make sure that your coloured costumes are in the right order.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-costume.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>To create a random sequence, you need to create a <em>list</em>. A list is just a variable that stores lots of data <em>in order</em>. Create a new list called <code class="blockdata">sequence</code>. As only your character needs to see the list, we can also click ‘For this sprite only’.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-list.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You should now see your empty list in the top-left of your stage, as well as lots of new blocks for using lists.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-list-blocks.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>Add this code to your character, to add a random number to your list (and show the correct costume) 5 times:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    when flag clicked
    delete (all v) of [sequence v]
    repeat (5)
        add (pick random (1) to (4)) to [sequence v]
        switch costume to (item (last v) of [sequence v]
        wait (1) secs
    end</code></pre>
<p>Notice that you have also emptied the list to begin with.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="challenge-adding-sound" class="level2 challenge">
<h2>Challenge: Adding sound</h2>
<p>Test your project a few times. You may notice that sometimes the same number is chosen twice (or more) in a row, making the sequence harder to memorise. Can you make a drum sound play each time the character changes costume?</p>
<p>Can you make a different drum sound play depending on the random number chosen? This will be <em>very</em> similar to your code to change the character’s costume.</p>

<section id="step-2-repeating-the-sequence" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 2: Repeating the sequence</h1>
<p>Let’s add 4 buttons, for the player to repeat the sequence they’ve remembered.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-1" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Add 4 sprites to your project, that will become buttons. Edit your 4 sprites, so that there’s 1 for each of the 4 colours.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-drums.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>When the red drum is clicked, you’ll need to broadcast a message to your character, letting them know that the red button has been clicked. Add this code to your red drum:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    when this sprite clicked
    broadcast [red v]</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When your character receives this message, they should check whether the number 1 is at the start of the list (which means that red is the next colour in the sequence). If it is, you can remove the number from the list, as it’s been guessed correctly. Otherwise it’s game over!</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    when I receive [red v]
    if &lt;(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]&gt; then
        delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
    else
        say [Game over!] for (1) secs
        stop [all v]
    end</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You could also display some flashing lights once the list is empty, as it means the entire sequence has been guessed correctly. Add this code to the end of your character’s <code class="blockevents">when flag clicked</code> script:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    wait until &lt; (length of [sequence v]) = [0]&gt;
    broadcast [won v] and wait</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Click on your stage, and add this code to make the backdrop change colour once the player has won.</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    when I receive [won v]
    play sound [drum machine v]
    repeat (50)
        change [color v] effect by (25)
        wait (0.1) secs
    end
    clear graphic effects</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<section id="challenge-creating-4-buttons" class="level2 challenge">
<h2>Challenge: Creating 4 buttons</h2>
<p>Repeat the steps above for your blue, green and yellow buttons. Which code will stay the same, and which code will change for each button?</p>
<p>You can also add sounds for when the buttons are pressed.</p>
<p>Remember to test the code you’ve added! Can you memorise a sequence of 5 colours? Is the sequence different each time?</p>

<section id="step-3-multiple-levels" class="level1 activity new-page">
<h1>Step 3: Multiple levels</h1>
<p>So far, the player only has to remember 5 colours. Let’s improve your game, so that the length of the sequence increases.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-2" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a new variable called <code class="blockdata">score</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-score.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>This <code class="blockdata">score</code> will be used to decide on the length of the sequence the player has to memorise. So, to begin with the score (and the sequence length) is 3. Add this code block to the start of your character’s <code class="blockevents">when flag clicked</code> code:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    set [score v] to [3]</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Instead of always creating a sequence of 5 colours, you now want the <code class="blockdata">score</code> to determine the sequence length. Change your character’s <code class="blockcontrol">repeat</code> loop (for creating the sequence) to:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    repeat (score)
    end</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If the sequence is guessed correctly, you should add 1 to the score, to increase the length of the sequence.</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    change [score v] by (1)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Finally, you need to add a <code class="blockcontrol">forever</code> loop around the code to generate the sequence, so that a new sequence is created for each level. This is how your character’s code should look:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    when flag clicked
    set [score v] to [3]
    forever
        delete (all v) of [sequence v]
        repeat (score)
            add (pick random (1) to (4)) to [sequence v]
            switch costume to (item (last v) of [sequence v]
            wait (1) secs
        end
        wait until &lt; (length of [sequence v]) = [0]&gt;
        broadcast [won v] and wait
        change [score v] by (1)
    end</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Get your friends to test out your game. Remember to hide the <code class="blockdata">sequence</code> list before they play it!</p></li>

<section id="step-4-high-score" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 4: High score</h1>
<p>Let’s save the high score, so that you can play against your friends.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-3" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Add 2 new variables to your project, called <code class="blockdata">high score</code> and <code class="blockdata">name</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If ever the game ends (by pressing the wrong button), you need to check whether the player’s score is higher than the current high score. If it is, you need to save the score as the high score, and store the name of the player. Here’s how your red button should look:</p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>    when I receive [red v]
    if &lt;(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]&gt; then
        delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
    else
        say [Game over!] for (1) secs
        if &lt; (score) &gt; (high score) &gt; then
            set [high score v] to [score v]
            ask [High score! What is your name?] and wait
            set [name v] to (answer)
        end
        stop [all v]
    end</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You’ll need to add this new code to the other 3 buttons too! Have you noticed that the ‘Game over’ code in each of the 4 buttons is exactly the same?</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-same.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>If ever you need to change any of this code, such as adding a sound or changing the ‘Game over!’ message, you’d have to change it 4 times! That could get annoying, and waste a lot of time.</p>
<p>Instead, you can define your own blocks, and reuse them in your project! To do this, click <code class="blockmoreblocks">more blocks</code>, and then ‘Make a block’. Call this new block ‘Game over’.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-more.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>Add the code from the <code class="blockcontrol">else</code> block from the red button to the new block that appears:</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-make-block.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>You’ve now made a new <em>function</em> called <code class="blockmoreblocks">Game over</code>, which you can use anywhere you like. Drag your new <code class="blockmoreblocks">Game over</code> block onto the 4 scripts for the buttons.</p>
<figure>
<img src="colour-use-block.png" alt="screenshot" /><figcaption>screenshot</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>Now add a sound for when the wrong button is pressed. You only need to add this code <em>once</em> in the <code class="blockmoreblocks">Game over</code> block that you made, and not 4 separate times!</p>
