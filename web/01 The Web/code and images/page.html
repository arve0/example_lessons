		<h1>This is the most important heading on the page</h1>
		<h2>This is another heading</h2>
		<p>Hello! Here is a paragraph of text. It can be short or long, and it can <a href="surprise.html">contain links</a>. You can for example mark some words as <strong>important</strong> in one way or <em>another</em>.</p>
		<h3>Lists</h3>
		<p>Here is a list of things I like in order of preference:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Kittens</li>
			<li>Space</li>
			<li>Lie-ins</li>
			<li>Playing games</li>
		</ol>
		<p>And here is a list of things I often do, but they are not in a particular order:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do my homework</li>
			<li>Read my favourite book</li>
			<li>Visit a friend</li>
			<li>Go for walks</li>
			<li>Watch films</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>Grouping things</h3>
		<div>
			<p>I have put this particular paragraph in a box. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a box that you can put other things into. It comes in useful when you want to group things together.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="notes_on_classes">You can use <code>classes</code> to annotate the elements in code. They can help you distinguish between the same elements that you might use for different things. <code>Classes</code> are not visible, but later you will learn how to use them to change appearance of things on the page.</p>
			<p class="notes_on_classes">You can have many elements with the same <code>class</code>.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="note_about_id">
			<p>You can also use <code>id</code> for a similar purpose: use it when you want to mark out a specific element</p>
			<p>You can only have <em>one</em> element with a specific <code>id</code> though, but as a bonus you can <a href="#kitten">link to that element</a> within the page.</p>
		</div>
