# Introduction { .intro}

Let's build a game: Hangman! The computer will pick a word, and the player can guess it letter-by-letter, but if they make too many wrong guesses, they'll lose.

# Step 1: Pick a word { .activity}

We start by picking a random word, so let's begin

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Open IDLE, and open a new window.
+ Write in the following code:
```{.language-python}
from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    print(word)
```
+ Save your program, and run it. What word does it print?
+ Run it again, does it print a different word?

Each time you run this program, it picks a random word from the list `["code", "club"]`, using the `choice` function.

# Step 2: Guess a letter { .activity}

Now we've picked a word, let's find out how to guess a letter.

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ With the same file, edit the code so it looks like this
```{.language-python}
from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    out = ""

    for letter in word:
        out = out + "_"

    print("Guess a letter in the word:", out)
```
+ Save and run the program.
+ You should see "Guess a letter in the word: ____", in the output window (the other window, not the one you've written your program in.) We use a for loop to build up some text with an underscore `_` for each letter in the word. The word "code" put in, will write out `____` to the screen.
+ Let's guess a letter! Change the code to look like this:
```{.language-python}
from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    out = ""

    for letter in word:
        out = out + "_"

    print("Guess a letter in the word, then press enter:", out)

    guess = input()

    if guess in word:
        print("Yay")
    else:
        print("Nope")
```

We use a new function `input()` to find out what the player typed. We use `if` to find out if the letter was in the word. We've got the essentials down, so let's continue onward.

(Python 2 Note: Use `raw_input` if you're on an old version of python)

# Step 3: Track the guesses { .activity}

Now we're going to use two features of python, lists and the `while` loop.

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ In the same file, edit the code to look like this:
```{.language-python}
from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    guessed = []

    while True:

        out = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter in guessed:
                out = out + letter
            else:
                out = out + "_"

        if out == word:
            print("You guessed", word)
            break


        print("Guess the word:", out)
        guess = input()

        if guess in guessed:
            print("Already guessed", guess)
        elif guess in word:
            print("Yay")
            guessed.append(guess)
        else:
            print("Nope")

        print()
```
+ Run the code, try guessing the letters. What we've done is put a loop, like `forever` in scratch, that will keep asking for letters from the player, until they guess the word. We also use a list, `guessed`, which we add the letters to when they're right. This program will loop forever until all the letters are guessed.

# Step 4: Track the mistakes { .activity}

Hangman should only give you a few chances to guess, rather than trying every letter in turn

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Edit the existing file, and change it to look like the following:
```{.language-python}
from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    guessed = []
    wrong = []

    while True:

        out = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter in guessed:
                out = out + letter
            else:
                out = out + "_"

        if out == word:
            print("You guessed", word)
            break

        print("Guess the word:", out)

        guess = input()

        if guess in guessed or guess in wrong:
            print("Already guessed", guess)
        elif guess in word:
            print("Yay")
            guessed.append(guess)
        else:
            print("Nope")
            wrong.append(guess)

        print()

```

We're using a new list, `wrong`, to store all the guesses that weren't right

Only one last thing before the game is complete, which is to only have a few chances to guess.

# Step 5: Only a few chances { .activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Edit the file, to introduce a new variable, `tries`:
```{.language-python}
from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    guessed = []
    wrong = []

    tries = 7

    while tries > 0:

        out = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter in guessed:
                out = out + letter
            else:
                out = out + "_"

        if out == word:
            break

        print("Guess the word:", out)
        print(tries, "chances left")

        guess = input()

        if guess in guessed or guess in wrong:
            print("Already guessed", guess)
        elif guess in word:
            print("Yay")
            guessed.append(guess)
        else:
            print("Nope")
            tries = tries - 1
            wrong.append(guess)

        print()

    if tries:
        print("You guessed", word)
    else:
        print("You didn't get", word)
```
+ Run the file, and see what happens when you guess wrong letters

# Step 6: Add some new words in { .activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Find the line in the source code:
```{.language-python}
    word = choice(["code", "club"])
```
+ Edit it to add more words, why not try
```{.language-python}
    word = choice(["code", "club", "robot", "party"])
```

Remember to put the words in quotes, and put a comma between them to make a list of words.
