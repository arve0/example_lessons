#Introduction:
This project teaches children how to run a simple Python program, and how to print text to the screen. Children will write programs to print ASCII art to the screen.

#Resources
For this project, Python will need to be installed. It is recommended that version 3.2 of Python is installed.

Children can also make use of the materials which accompany these challenges. Files included in the 'Project Resources' folder (found under the 'Download Project Materials' link):

+ AboutMe.py
+ Scarf.py

Make sure that each child has read and write access to their own copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ Running a Python program;
+ Dealing with syntax and logical errors;
+ Printing text;
+ Calculations using text.


#Challenges
+ What’s on your mind? - using the `print()` function;
+ About yourself - multiple-line text strings.
+ Words and numbers - expressions using numbers and text strings.
+ Code a scarf - expressions using numbers and text strings.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Children should make sure they type `.py` at the end of their filename when saving. This allows IDLE to use syntax highlighting, which improves code readability.
+ Children will not yet have learnt about the backslash escape character `\`. This means that they will get an error message if they try and use a backslash immediately before the end speechmark in their `print()` statement. This problem can be solved by putting a space between a backslash and any speech marks.
+ Children should not use the speech mark character `"` anywhere within a print statement, as the editor will incorrectly assume that this marks the end of the printed text.
