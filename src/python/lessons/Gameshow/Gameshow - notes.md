#Introduction:
This project teaches children how to use `while` loops and random numbers to create various versions of a number guessing game.

#Resources
For this project, Python will need to be installed. It is recommended that version 3.2 of Python is installed.

Children can also make use of the materials which accompany these challenges. Files included in the 'Project Resources' folder (found under the 'Download Project Materials' link):

+ Gameshow.py

Make sure that each child has read and write access to their own copy of these resources.

You can find a completed version of this project's challenges by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ KeepingScore.py
