# Coding a comic

## Introduction

In this project children create a sequence of juxtaposed images and texts, also known as *a comic*, with HTML and CSS.

> Do you **like comics**? 

> Do you have a **story to tell**?

> Can you turn a bunch of images into **your own Web-comic**?


<!--### Skills needed

* Basic **HTML**
	* tags (opening, closing and nesting) -->

## Resources

Files included in this project's *__Resources__* folder

* *waiter.png*

Software required

* A code editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* A browser with Developer Tools enabled. We recommend [Google Chrome](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/index.html#eula)

Children are asked to use their own images in this project, but they may want to source images online. They should therefore be able to access resources like [Flickr Creative Commons](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/).


## Learning Objectives

1. Use a **code editor** to write code, and the **browser** to debug it
2. Structure a Web page with the **appropriate markup**
3. Identify and use **openly-licensed images**
4. Create something new on the Web using existing resources
5. Use CSS to change the **style and layout** of a Web page
6. Understand the **syntactic differences** between HTML and CSS
7. **HTML**
	1. Elements introduced: `section`, `img`, `p`
	2. Nest HTML elements inside each other to create a structured hierarchy
	3. Use `class` names to create groups of elements that share some properties
	4. Use `id` names to reference unique elements
	5. Understand the difference between `class` and `id` 
		
8. **CSS**
	1. Use *attribute selectors* to target HTML elements appropriately
	2. `width` and `height` 
	3. `margin` and `padding`
	4. `border`
	5. `position` and offsets
	6. `float`
	7. `overflow`
	8. typographical properties such as `font-size`, `text-align`, `font-weight`, `line-height`  and `font-family`
	9. `:after` pseudo-class
	

## Challenges

1. Use the browser's Inspector to experiment with CSS properties 
2. Copy-paste existing elements instead of writing copies
3. Use `img` to add image files to an HTML document
4. Use `top` and `left` offsets to position elements
5. Use `id` and `classes` to make both unique and shared CSS rules
6. Use `float` to control the document flow
7. Use `overflow` to control the display of nexted elements
8. Use CSS typographical properties in conjunction with web-fonts to personalize a Web page layout
9. Use `:after` and borders to create triangular shapes


## Frequently asked questions

1. *Why has the `img` no closing thing like the others?* 
2. *I copied the X file into here but it doesn't come up in my page.*
3. *My page looks weird.* 
	
	Check for *syntax errors* in the HTML: unnecessary spaces, closing tags are missing, brackets are missing, quotation marks are missing, etc
4. *My browser is not picking up the CSS I just wrote.*

	Check for *typos* and *syntax errors* in the `style`: unnecessary spaces, brackets are missing, quotation marks are missing, etc 
5. *I changed something in the browser and now it's gone.*

	You may have to explain that changes in the Inspector are temporary. Useful while making a page, but wiped on refresh. Otherwise anyone could hack (or improve) any website :)
6. *I want to have X panels on the same line but the browser is putting them on two lines.*
7. *My image is too big for this page.*	
8. *I picked a font from Google Fonts but it's not showing up in my comic.*
