+ CloneWars.sb2

#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt, and demonstrates how sprites can create clones of _other_ sprites, and how multiple clones can be used as projectiles.

#Challenges
+ "Fixing the lightning" - using a `wait` {.blockcontrol} block to reduce the frequency of the lightning;
+ "Lives and score" - creating `lives` {.blockdata}, `score` {.blockdata} and `highscore` {.blockdata} variables;
+ "Improve your game" - adding extra enemies, health packs, etc.
