#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt, and shows how broadcasts can be used to create a simple game menu system.

#Challenges
+ "Changing costumes" - changing how the game character looks in response to correct and incorrect answers;
+ "Adding a score" - adding a point for every correct question answered;
+ "Start screen" - changing the stage backdrop in response to the `start` {.blockevents} and `end` {.blockevents} broadcast messages, creating 2 game 'screens';
+ "Improved animation" - using loops and effects to improve the correct/wrong graphics animation;
+ "Sound and music" - consolidating learning of music loops and sound effects;
+ "Race to 10 points" - changing the game logic to create a new game objective;
+ "Instruction screen" - consolidating the use of broadcasts to create a game menu, by adding a new 'instructions' button and screen.
