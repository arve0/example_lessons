#Interactive Role Play - Introduction

##What is this?

The following documents are ideas on interactive role plays that can be conducted with the kids in the attempt to cement some of the core programming concepts in their minds.

##Why do we need this?

Well, in short, you don't.

However, I have found that in the first 5 weeks of term 1 the kids were so excited about Code Club that they zoomed through their worksheets, copying the scripts from the examples and not stopping to understand what is was they were actually doing.

This meant that when the children's scripts were not working as expected, they didn't know where to look to fix them and instead resorted to asking me.

On top of that, as things like variables and loops continued to appear in worksheets, they never really understood what they were or how and why to use them and therefore they we essentially new concepts that they didn't undertand every time.

I thought I'd try this as a way to hopefully cement some of the core concepts such as variables, loops, conditional statements etc in their minds.

By having the kids pretend to be `sprite`s and acting out the `script`s they will hopefully work up a connection between what they are doing and what they end up programming.


##Contribute

This is a work in progress.  I intend to add more examples as I try them out.

Please use these if you think they will come in handy and even more importantly, please contribute to them if you have any great ideas or find something works particularly well, or not so.

All contributions are welcome.
